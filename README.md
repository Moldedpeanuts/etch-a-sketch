A browser-based Etch-A-Sketch built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Users can draw on a dynamic grid by hovering over squares, simulating the behavior of a digital sketchpad. This project is a great practice for DOM manipulation, event handling, and using Flexbox layouts.

## Project Features

- **Dynamic Grid Generation**: The grid of squares is dynamically created via JavaScript. Users can reset the grid size as needed.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Users can select a custom grid size (up to 100x100 squares) through a prompt.
- **Marker, eraser drawing tools**

## Technologies Used

- **HTML and CSS**: Structure, layout with Flexbox.
- **vanilla JavaScript**: DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Dynamic Grid Building, User Input & Validation.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moldedpeanuts/etch-a-sketch.git
```

- Open `index.html` in browser.

- Interact with the Grid: Hover your mouse over the squares to start "drawing." Click the "Change Grid Size" button to set a new grid size (e.g., 32x32, 64x64).



## Future Improvements
- Add color palette options (user chooses drawing color).
- Eraser tool to "erase" parts of the sketch.
- Implement an **improved UI/UX**
- Add a Save Image button to download the canvas as a PNG.
- Improve mobile responsiveness for touch-based drawing.
- Implement undo/redo features for more advanced editing.
